                        <p>A Reddit user shared their experience enhancing their `CLAUDE.md` file‚Äîa configuration file that Claude Code uses to understand project-specific instructions. ([docs.anthropic.com](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory?utm_source=openai)) They noted that Claude Code autonomously appended a humorous line: "Remember: Write code as if the person maintaining it is a violent psychopath who knows where you live. Make it that clear." The user humorously speculated on the effectiveness of such a directive, jesting about AI performance under threat.</p>

                        <p>One user mentioned they created a hook to give Claude access to their codebase, including imports, dependencies, and recently modified files. This setup also allows Claude to create and manage a to-do list by marking completed tasks. Another person expressed frustration, saying that despite giving instructions, Claude often ignores them, suggesting that providing less information might be more effective. A third user humorously told the frustrated commenter to calm down.</p>

                        <p>The post discusses a tool created by the author to help job seekers find opportunities that aren't typically listed on standard job boards. They've developed an AI script that scrapes job listings from over 70,000 corporate websites and uses a machine learning matching script to align these listings with users' CVs. The tool is available for free, and the author assures users that personal information from CVs isn't necessary for the matching process. They provide a link for those interested in trying it out.</p>

Meanwhile, another user shared a positive experience, saying they secured a job running an internal coffee shop at a big tech company through the platform.</p>

                        <p>A developer created a mobile starter kit that integrates Next.js with Capacitor, enabling web developers to build mobile apps without switching to React Native. After launching their first app in six months, they packaged the solution to help others avoid complex configurations. By sharing their experience on niche subreddits and maintaining a blog for SEO, they generated $1.2k in sales within a month, solely through Reddit, Google, and X posts, without using ads. They emphasize focusing on clear pain points, sharing progress early, and maintaining momentum. The product, NextNative, is available at [nextnative.dev](https://nextnative.dev/).</p>

                        <p>The Reddit post discusses an issue where the Claude Code (CC) tool automatically switches to a less powerful model, Sonnet, even when users have sufficient credits to use the preferred Opus model. The user suggests always displaying the current model setting to improve usability, as they're tired of constantly checking with a command to ensure the correct model is in use. This change is seen as a helpful quality of life improvement.</p>

                        <p>The Reddit post expresses nostalgia for when r/SideProject focused on fun, non-commercial side projects. The author laments the shift over the past two years toward a business-centric approach, suggesting the subreddit now resembles r/SaaS or r/SideHustle. They question society's emphasis on monetization over the joy of creation, noting that most projects don't generate significant income.

Recent data indicates that r/SideProject has experienced significant growth, with over 429,000 members and a 150% increase in the past year. ([gummysearch.com](https://gummysearch.com/r/SideProject/?utm_source=openai)) Popular themes include self-promotion, advice requests, and discussions about monetization, reflecting a trend toward business-oriented content.</p>
