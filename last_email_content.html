                    <p>The Reddit post summarizes best practices for using Claude Code, emphasizing the importance of treating it like a "brilliant, amnesiac expert." It advises setting up an organized workspace with a "Core Rulebook" (CLAUDE.md), a memory-bank folder for context, and optionally installing an MCP server for enhanced capabilities. Planning is crucial, with a checklist-driven PLAN.md guiding each step. The approach aligns with AI-driven workflows, emphasizing preparation and structured interactions to maximize efficiency.</p>

                    <p>One user mentioned a strategy where Claude builds the UI first with dummy data before implementing backend logic, although they questioned the reasoning, suggesting backend should typically come first. Another person criticized the idea of not fixing flawed code through conversation, arguing that even a 70% solution can be improved with discussion. Someone else simply stated they don't trust Gemini.</p>

                    <p>The post discusses a new approach to managing large codebases using AI tools. The author used to struggle with massive codebases, finding it hard to identify which files to modify for specific tasks. Initially, they tried using Claude alone, but it couldn't handle the large context effectively. The breakthrough came by using Gemini as a project manager to handle the big picture and Claude for focused coding tasks.

The workflow involves uploading the entire codebase to Gemini, which can process it all thanks to its large context window. Gemini then provides a concise list of essential files and a detailed briefing document (claude.md) that outlines the project architecture and task goals. This document is used to inform Claude, which then efficiently provides precise code suggestions. This method significantly improves efficiency,</p>

                    <p>One user thinks the idea of using Gemini with Claude is good but not practical for huge codebases because even a 1M context size is too small. They suggest using code augmentation to identify the right files before involving Gemini and Claude. Another person says using Gemini CLI with Claude CLI is more reliable. Someone else agrees that Gemini isn't sufficient for large codebases, noting that while it can handle medium-sized ones, it struggles with truly large codebases due to context limitations.</p>

                    <p>The Reddit user developed MindfulScroll, an Android app designed to help users monitor and limit their time spent on short-form video platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. The app allows users to set daily limits on the number of videos watched or the total time spent in vertical video feeds. 

As of July 2025, MindfulScroll is available on the Google Play Store. 

The developer notes that an iOS version isn't available due to restrictions on accessing screen structure and analyzing video feeds, and also mentions the cost of acquiring an iPhone as a barrier.</p>
