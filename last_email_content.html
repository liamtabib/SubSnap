                    <h3><span class="indicator post-indicator"></span>Post Summary</h3>
                    <p>The Reddit post discusses best practices for using Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI tool for AI coding assistance. It emphasizes treating Claude as a "brilliant, amnesiac expert" that requires an external memory setup to function effectively. The guide suggests setting up a workspace with essential files like CLAUDE.md, which contains core rules, and a memory-bank folder to track project details and progress. It also recommends installing an MCP server to enhance Claude's capabilities by allowing it to interact with the local machine. The guide stresses the importance of planning, using a PLAN.md file to outline a checklist-driven approach for project execution.</p>

                    <p>One user suggested starting with the UI using Claude and then adding backend logic, though they questioned this approach, saying backend-first is usually better. Another person argued against needing perfect code from the start, saying fixing clear flaws through conversation is usually enough and aiming for a 70% solution can work. Someone else talked about using Claude's ability to remember customization through artifacts, likening it to a "memory keeper" that helps maintain consistency.</p>

                    <p>The post is about someone who developed a legal AI chatbot using MistralAI, specifically fine-tuned for California criminal defense law. The creator aimed to provide lawyers, especially defense attorneys, with a digital co-counsel knowledgeable about jury instructions, DUI defenses, and more. They chose MistralAI for its speed and flexibility, making it suitable for niche areas like law. The AI can spot issues in police reports and suggest creative defenses, which the creator finds exciting. They're not selling anything but are open to feedback to improve the project. They mention their website, bearister.ai, and offer a free demo code for those interested.</p>

                    <p>The post is from someone looking for an AI agent to automate the task of submitting their startup to various SaaS and AI directories. The process is repetitive and involves filling out slightly different forms on each site. They've tried using tools like Zapier and semi-automation, but haven't found a smooth solution. They are seeking a narrow AI agent that can be configured once to loop through directories, fill out forms, handle errors, and log submissions. The poster is asking if such a tool exists or if anyone has developed something similar.</p>

The author is curious about how others manage updates to this file as their projects grow in complexity. They note that Claude doesn't automatically update `Claude.md` after the initial `/init` run.

They found Rork AI intuitive for visualizing app ideas but encountered challenges that required them to manually edit code with ChatGPT's help. Despite some hiccups, like issues with onboarding and authentication, they rated Rork a 7 out of 10 for its visual capabilities but noted the need for precise prompts. Through this project, they learned about tools like GitHub and ExpoGo and used the Mac Terminal for the first time. Trilo is currently under review on TestFlight, and they're eager to continue improving it. They offered to share more about their process with anyone interested.</p>
